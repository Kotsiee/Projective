A collaborative freelancing marketplace that lets businesses hire entire teams to deliver projects end-to-end — predictable costs, faster delivery, and fairer work for freelancers.

- Fixed stage pricing (no endless bidding)
- Built-in transparency for clients
- Future-ready (marketplace + AI-guided hiring)

### Monetization (Phase 2+)

- 10% service fee per project stage
- Subscription tiers for freelancers/teams
- Marketplace commissions (digital assets)
- Team analytics & premium project templates

### Status

- MVP under development using Deno Fresh, Supabase, and Rust WASM.
